Introduction:

CARBON is the firmware for the K66 CARBON Sequencer. The hardware is built
and sold by Kilpatrick Audio / QP925 Trading Corp. The hardware is not open
source and schematics or hardware plans are not available. Although you are
free to use code from CARBON for any purpose as per the GPL, we hope that
you will consider buying CARBON to help support continued development of
unique musical equipment and improvements to the CARBON codebase.


Support for sources:

Andrew Kilpatrick and Kilpatrick Audio provides NO SUPPORT for the code and
scripts provided here. If you can't figure it out or get it to work for you,
sorry about that. We make our living by selling hardware, which we support
very well. We believe in open source and want to contribute what we can, but
simply do not have the resouces to answer emails related to this code. All
feature and bug requests, or suggestions should be performed through the
online GitHub source repository. Emails received directly by Kilpatrick Audio 
or Andrew Kilpatrick will unfortunately go unanswered.

CARBON Development Tools:

Note: Some changes might be needed to various scripts used. These are
provided with the distribution for completeness. We develop CARBON on Mint 
Linux and the tools work for us but might not work for you. We don't know
anything about Windows or OS X so please don't ask about building on these
platforms.

The config.h contains many config options for the entire system including
settings that affect debugging. Specifically, debug print output is supported
over MIDI using a SYSEX format. This allows the use of the log.c functions
to send formatted strings to a host PC. You will need a program to decode
these messages, which are a SYSEX header followed by 7 bit ASCII. We use an
internal tool but this is not available at this time.


Makefile generator:
- makegen - Makefile Generator - by: Andrew Kilpatrick
  - https://github.com/hires/makegen
  - The path to your build tool (gnuarm tools) must be set in makegen-run.sh.

Compiler:
- gcc version 4.9.3 20150303 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_9-branch 
  revision 221220] (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 
- a newer version is probably okay and we are currently developing
  on version 7.2.1
- we normally put this in our user bin dir like /home/andrew/bin/

Drivers:
- updated to STM32Cube V1.11.0 on 2016-03-11 (included with source)

Middlewares: (USB stuff)
- running V1.8.0 - no changes in V1.11.0 so didn't update (included with source)
- there are modifications made to some ST-supplied files due to bugs or
  workarounds that we required so please do a diff before updating to make
  sure that you don't clobber important changes

Generating Makefile when adding new sources:
- use the makegen tool by Kilpatrick Audio - https://github.com/hires/makegen
- we normally put this in our user bin dir like /home/andrew/bin/

Flashing over JTAG:
- use OpenOCD with the script provided - we use a JLink programmer
- if you want to save money the ST-Link V2 programmer also works with
  OpenOCD and should do most of the same things as the JLink

Flashing over DFU:
- you need dfu-util for Linux or your operating system
- put CARBON in DFU mode by holding down the power button when applying
  power to the unit
- use the dfu flashing script provided
